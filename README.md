The main Objective of this repository is to introduce new way of Website designing using Parallax Scrolling in CSS.

Details:

Parallax is a 3d effect used in various websites to make webpages attractive. In this effect, as we scroll, the background of the webpages moves at a different speed than the foreground making it look brilliant to the eyes.
This effect is a great visual but an easy method to implement with the help of CSS.
First, let us understand what is happening in the given examples.
The effect is created because the image in the background is kept fixed with no movement but other images are moving. This simple technique makes this effect look brilliant.
